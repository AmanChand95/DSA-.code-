class Solution {
public:
    int findKthPositive(vector<int>& arr, int k) {
        int s = 0, e = arr.size();
        while (s < e) {
            int mid = s + (e - s) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] - mid - 1 < k) {
                s = mid + 1;
            } else {
                e = mid;
            }
        }
        return s + k;
    }
};

Approach:
Use binary search to find the index where the number of missing positive integers up to that index is less than k. The kth missing positive integer will be s + k, where s is the final value of the start pointer.
Time Complexity: O(log n), where n is the size of the array
Space Complexity: O(1)
